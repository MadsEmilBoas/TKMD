Final Project Olympic Swimming

The primary purpose of the TKDM Olympic Swimming Data Analysis Project is to explore how swimmer performance has changed from 1924 to 2020. Using Olympic data, the team analyzes trends in race times across different strokes and distances, compares male and female performance, and examines which countries have dominated the sport over time. Through visualizations, statistical tests, and regression analysis, the project aims to uncover insights into athletic progress, gender gaps, and shifting global competitiveness in Olympic swimming.
